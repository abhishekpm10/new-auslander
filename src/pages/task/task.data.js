        Sherlock sets the string name on that machine and presses the button
        after pressing the button(winds started howling, describe some more strange activites) and they felt like they were uplifted and bumped on the same place)

        The face of the body was not burnt properly(describe a little as identifiable) having a small scar on his forehead
        Seeking to the surprise, Sherlock realises that the dead body was of John's(Henry’s missing associate ) whose photo he had seen earlier in Buckingham palace(make this as  a little change while entrance of Sherlock in Buckingham Palace in part1)
        Sherlock gets confused with lots of questions arising in his mind
        1.How John was present in 1918?
        2.How John is related to Lucas’s father's kidnapping mystery?
        3.why did the black hooded figure killed Henry’s close associate?

        Sherlock finds the crumbs of leaves lying beneath the cross…on close observation  he finds out the the crumb was of oak leaves which he had seen earlier near Charles body
        Sherlock makes a guess that the black hooded figure might have hit him on his head while he was in Aylesbury farm house…so he might have become unconscious and then brought him to 1918 and burned him alive …..all that on the same day of Prince Charles's death and Jonas being missing
        Seeing to the right side, there was a message written over wall-“Hssh…Too late for this one…being the most intelligent detective I had expected better from you….Isn’t your game on yet?...Right after 2 hours …the next murder will tick your door..If you have  got gut’s, then try and save next man…code is “CSEO” (use appropriate words for guts)
        Sherlock and you instantly put the message in time machine…..and gets teleported to same place in year 1927 as he was able to decipher-“0-A 1-C 2-E 3-G………”( mechanism of code)

        Gun-fleet sands ,Offshore of thames river ,London  1927
        Sherlock sees the black hooded figure watching the man get burnt at offshore and run towards him to catch him….but the black hooded man watches Sherlock approaching him so uses time machine and vanishes in an instant
        Sherlock curses his misfortune but then he take a closer look towards the body lying offshore and finds that he was none other than Albert(Henry’s another associate)…..Sherlock still not able to understand why the black hooded figure is murdering henry’s associatives???
        He searches nearby and then finds a boat that has something written on it-“He is tall, he is accurate, he shows the same thing from any direction, he feels the wind on his face, and has his hands over his face……You are trapped in my world Sherlock….just two more times and everything will be over forever…..Try and stop me from killing David in 1859

        And they change his name to Jonas!!..so basically Lucas and my father are same person..Lucas and Jonas are same…in short my brother and father are same being…we are the family that is being created by time and if I hadn’t shoot the Lucas's time machine our family would have been disappeared and then we would not have experienced our happy family life even if for a short time”
